    <p>Actually, in this crutial world, we can't live without any sorrow and misconception. Though we should  have  concern about what we do, did and what we will do. Allah will help help us, if we fall in a improper or danger situation. No one but Allah can help us. But the main thing is we need keep our faith on Him. We love our prophet. He is our ultimate teacher. A person, who always obeys our Prophrt's intruction, will not fall into any danger. However, it is obivious that Allah will give you some problem and incertainity to exam you either you perfect or not.</p>
